    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Cross-Team GenAI Pipeline Suite}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {Q3-Q4 2024}
    {Led the creation of a shared suite of Vertex AI Pipelines to manage transcription and summarization artifacts across GenAI experiments. Designed the system to promote processed outputs as reusable experiment components, reducing redundant computations and unifying team workflows.}

    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Multimodal RAG Knowledge Hub}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {Q3-Q4 2024}
    {Built a modular ingestion pipeline for centralized handling of RAG data, supporting both textual and multimodal formats. Focused on metadata-aware chunking, document provenance, and enabling downstream LLM workflows with enriched, structured inputs.}

    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Gemini Fine-Tuning Enablement}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {Q4 2024}
    {Enabled Gemini model fine-tuning capabilities with standardized data validation, evaluation workflows, and deployment practices. Designed the setup to be easily replicable across multiple internal teams.}

    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Real-Time Embedding Search for Cold Start}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {H2 2023}
    {Created a recommendation engine using vector similarity to personalize onboarding during cold-start scenarios. Combined user interaction signals with content popularity filters and deployed the system under strict latency constraints.}

    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Beam-Based Scalable RAG Pipeline}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {H2 2023}
    {Designed a scalable ingestion pipeline using Apache Beam and Dataflow to chunk and structure large aviation manuals. Added support for document metadata, enabling precise retrievals for downstream summarization and QA tasks.}

    \cventry
    {Machine Learning Engineer}
    {Dataform Workflow Wrapper System}
    {NeuralWorks (LATAM Airlines)}
    {H2 2023}
    {Replaced legacy Python/Kubernetes-based orchestration with a Dataform-based wrapper framework. Standardized SQL workflow creation for non-engineering teams and significantly reduced operational complexity.}
